# Build a clone of the Google Homepage
- - - - 

**Some Advice...**

- Break this up into 3 parts
	- HTML structure & Main Elements
	- Navbar
	- Footer
	
- Talk with your partner and then divide and conquer 
	- One of you tackle the HTML structure/main elements
	- One of you complete the navbar and footer

- For the main elements
	- Start with just putting the main elements on the page 
		- the logo image and search form. 
		- then get them placed horizontally. 
		- You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your `<img>` tag.

- For the Navbar
	- First build the content (if it hasn't been placed in the HTML)
	- THEN try to position it. 
	- google: "how to build a horizontal CSS navbar" if you get lost lost.

- For the Footer
	-  This will be similar to the navbar
	-  you'll probably have to make 2 separate lists to make it look right.

**Other Notes**:

- DONT BE A PERFECTIONIST! You're just trying to make it look like google.com (not function like it) 
- Don't worry about spacing things exactly to the pixel. 
- Ignore the dropdown menus, form submissions and hover-highlighting.
- Try to do as much and you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code).
