## Write an Inventory Program in Ruby

- The program should do the following: 
	- Return a list of existing inventory items and allow use to update those items
	- Allow the user to add new items to the inventory
	- The list should reflect the new items
	- Allow the user to delete items 
Here are a few tips: 
- You can create an inventory of anything. Some of my favorites that have been turned in are: 
	- Beers
	- Jelly Beans
	- Shoe Strings
	- Records (vinyl)
	- Action Figures
	- Ice Cream
	- Oregon Trail Inventory Items
- Use Hashes 
	- keys = items
	- values = quantity
- When you find yourself writing redundant code (for application logic) turn it into a method
- Make use of control flow and loops

- Finally, break this down one step at a time
	- Decide on your items
	- Write your hash to store the items
	- Get the inventory list to print to the screen
	- push to GitHub and CELEBRATE!
	- Work on the logic for updating items
	- push to GitHub and CELEBRATE!
	- work on the logic for adding new items
	- push to GitHub and CELEBRATE!
	- work on deleting items
	- push to GitHub and CELEBRATE!
	- write a loop to keep the program running until the user has finished all tasks
	- push to GitHub and CELEBRATE!
